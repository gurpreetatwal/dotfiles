# dotfiles [![Build Status][ci-image]][ci-url]
All of my config files for linux


## TODO
Setup `dunst` as notification daemon
notes:
  - `notify-send` is in the `libnotify-bin` package
  - default conf file is at `/etc/xdg/dunst/dunstrc`

Look into gnome-keyring-daemon
Create systemd unit for ssh-agent
Look into moving it all into ansible
